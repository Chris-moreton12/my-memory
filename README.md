 ## UX

 <a name="ux"></a>

 ### Pre-project Planning
> Before starting this project, I had a look over some examples from previous students and some examples that were given to me as part of Code Institutes learning sessions. I took inspiration for ideas and came up wit the plan to create a memory game which tests memory but also perseverance with the change to fail the game at any point.

# UX design

## Strategy Plane

### To determine the best approach to this project I started with researching the needs of a game built to satify the player and allow thm to enjoy the creation.

## User Stories

### User
> As a user I would like to be able to play a game that tests my memory that is quick, easy and fun to play.  
> As a user I would like this game to be challenging without excluding the fun. I would like to be able to play on my mobile device with ease.
> As a user I would like to be able to be tested but I would like to be able to play the game over again without knowing where each card will be.

### Webite Owner
> As a game developer, I would like my users ot have fun whilst playing my game, I would like my users to be challenged and I would like the game to be played over again without the user finding it boring.
> As a game developer, I would like my users to be able to play this game on multiple different devices with ease.

## Scope Plane
> The game should be easy to understand how the game works without the need for rules, however for accessibility, the game will display rules upon entering the site.  
> The game should have a welcome message which describes the rules of the game once the user enters the site.
> The game should display a selection of cards each faced down and each card should turn once clicked, a maximum of 2 cards should be able to be turned and if the cards match, they remain turned if they do not, the return to their default state.
> The game should be able to be played on multipe devices and the images should adjust relatively to each screen size.

## Structure Plane
> To achieve the above goals, am gam will be created which will show 15 cards, these cards will include 7 pairs and one fail card which ends the game. Upon clicking the cards, they shall turn and show the picture on the reverse side. If 2 cards are clicked which match, these shall remain turned. If 2 cards are clicked which do not match, they shall return face down. the game is complete once all 7 pairs are found by avoiding the fail card. Due to their being a fail card, there will be no countdown on lives (unlimited). 

**Home Page**
> The one oage that will be displayed will have all 15 cards displayed along with a header and a footer. The header has the title and a toggle button to change the game from light to dark mode for accessibility.

## Skeleton Plane

### Home Page Desktop Wireframe

### Home Page Smaller Device Wireframe
![Home Page Smaller Device Wireframe]()

> The deisgn I have implemented in the wire frame is in aim of making the game simple, responsive and user friendly.
> The image on the back of the cards (the image displayed before turning) has been created by me with the help of some free images sourced, the images sourced will be referenced in the relevant section.

## Surface Plane

### Color
> I decided for this project that to make it stand out and to give the users an enjoyable expeirence, that color was required. Each card has a different picture whcih allows for a variety of colors to be shown in aim of making the game enjoyable.

> The decision on colors that I made was to incorporate. 

 - #color code

>These colors allow each part of my page to stand out which allow for user enjoyability. The abiltiy to toggle from dark to light mode also allows for user enjoyabiltiy and accessibility.
>The images within this project allow for a variety of different colors which alows them to stand out from the page.
